# Conference Organizer

A text-based Java application allowing users to keep track of scheduled events at a conference. 
The project was developed as part of a team of eight people for a second-year software design course at the University of Toronto. 

This program allows different types of users (Attendee, Speaker, Organizer etc.) to login and interact with information about scheduled events depending on their role. It also supports a friends list, messaging, and raffle feature along with role-specific actions.

## Getting Started

Running the program as currently intended requires the **IntelliJ IDEA** integrated development environment by JetBrains and an
appropriate JDK such as **Java SE Development Kit 8**, both of which can be downloaded at the links below.

* [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

To mimic the certain specific IntelliJ settings used during development, go to File -> Project Structure -> Project Settings -> Project and use the following settings:
* Project SDK set to **version 1.8**.
* Project language level set to **8 - Lambdas, type annotations etc**.

Once installed, open the src folder in IntellJ and run.

## Contributions and Legacy
My most significant responsibility was in the design of the project, a task mainly taken on by a sole few members.
This includes the decisions to use certain design patterns and the inheritance structure of some of the subclasses.
This responsibility is so prominent in my mind that when I think back on this project, the nuances and difficulties in designing good software is my main takeaway from this project.

I was also equally as involved in coding. It is hard to pinpoint any one location of my work due to the ideas and constant refactoring of my fellow design teammates, but you will find much of my work in the event, user, and system packages. 

Specifics of my responsibilities chronicled during the development can be found in personal_reflections.txt.

And to this day, I still write git commit messages as recommended in [this reading](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams that was given to us by the course instructional team. :) 

## Acknowledgements
This project was certainly not possible without the effort of my seven other team members: Rudy, Robin, Thaneeshan, Matthew, Brandon, Angela, and Samritha.
A special gratitude-filled thank you goes to Rudy who worked directly with me in calls for countless hours over many days as we deliberated over design decisions.

Another warm and personal thank you goes to our supervising TA, Allen, who gave insight on certain decisions we struggled with---even when the
emails detailing my entire thought process were late and long-winded.
